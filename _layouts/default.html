    <h2 id="firstInfoHeader">About this workshop</h2>
<p>This workshop will be heavily inspired by the work of Daniel Shiffman in his book, <a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/"><i>The Nature of Code</i></a>. Shiffman describes his book as such:
<div id="quote">
<i>How can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? How can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This book focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems using Processing.</i>
</div>

<br />
<p>One slight difference will be that this workshop will be entirely in JavaScript using the p5.js library, which is a port of the Processing library (which was originally written in Java) to JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>My main goal in running this workshop is to work with other developers to showcase opportunities in coding that may not be obviously apparent at first. For me, coding can often feel like a place where I‚Äôm unable to express a more creative perspective that I might more easily be able to do using other outlets. Creative coding has helped me to combine my technical knowledge of programming with my desire to practice and study art and more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù creativity. More concretely, I think that attendees will be able to gain an increased technical knowledge out of this course, and could find creative coding to be a great outlet for learning more about a new coding language or skills for practicing art.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>While not explicitly required, a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming fundamentals would be very helpful for this course. A basic knowledge of JavaScript would also be very helpful, but I will aim to make the code we go over parsable and approachable for beginners. </p>

<h2>Workshop Leader Qualifications</h2>
<p>I am very interested in exploring the intersection of art, the natural world, and code. I think that practicing creative coding allows for an escape from the often-monotonous CRUD app workflow, allowing us to explore different avenues of creativity and learn about aspects of the programming that we may not encounter in our traditional workflow. That being said, many of the technical challenges that we will encounter in this course will either be directly or indirectly applicable to situations a developer encounters in their day-to-day work.</p>

<h2>Cadence/Misc Information</h2>
<p>I'd like to avoid people having to choose between client work and attending these workshop sessions, so I am planning to run these courses over lunch. I'm planning on running at least three lunch sessions, though this course could easily extend to six sessions if there is continued interest and consistent attendance. While I'm calling it a "workshop", I don't plan on attendees actually having to type code onto a computer to benefit from attending (though it would be great if you did)! Additionally, I am not going to have any homework for these courses. I will provide additional resources if attendees are interested in diving deeper into a given topic.</p>
