    <h2 id="firstInfoHeader">About this workshop</h2>
<p>This workshop will be heavily inspired by the work of Daniel Shiffman in his book, the Nature of Code. Shiffman describes his book as such:
<div id="quote">
<i>How can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? How can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This book focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems using Processing.</i>
</div>

<br />
<p>One slight difference will be that this workshop will be entirely in JavaScript (at least the first time around) using the p5.js library, which is a port of Processing to JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>My main goal in running this workshop is to work with other developers and non-developers to showcase opportunities in coding that may not be obviously apparent at first. For me, coding can often feel like a place where I’m unable to express a more creative perspective that I might more easily be able to do using other outlets. Creative coding has helped me to combine my technical knowledge of programming with my desire to practice and study art and more “tradiitonal” creativity. I think that non-developers will be able to get a lot out of this course, and could find creative coding to be a great outlet for learning code or practicing art.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>While not explicitly required, a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming fundamentals would be very helpful for this course. A basic knowledge of JavaScript would also be very helpful, but I would hope that a lot of the code that we go over would be easily parseable and approachable.</p>

<h2>Workshop Leader Qualifications</h2>
<p>I am by no means a master at creative coding or simulating the natural world via code. Having said that, I am very interested in exploring the intersection of art, the natural world, and code. I think that practicing creative coding allows for an escape from the often-monotonous CRUD app workflow, allowing us to explore different avenues of creativity and learn about aspects of the programming that we may not encounter in our traditional workflow.</p>
